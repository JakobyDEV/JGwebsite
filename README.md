# Cweb - Catweb

Catweb is my first HTML project. Started learning HTMl recently and the first idea which came to my mind was making a website about/with.. Cats.

current todo:

~~#overhauling the looks -low priority~~ #still a bit to do, #working on some graphic designes

~~#fixing scaling on mobile phones -high priority~~ Looks much better now #looking for a fix for the mobie version, since the background ain´t showing up

~~#adding more cats - maybe~~ Welcome Wobby!

### No updates soon! Sorry :C. I´ll focus on my personal website about ME, to increse my chances of finding a decent job. After the website is done, I might update the CatOSP with my new earned skills###
